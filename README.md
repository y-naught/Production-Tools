# Production Tools

Production tools is a Rhino plugin which helps expedite the process of preparing models for drawings sets.

There are two parts to the system
1. Layout Manager - Assists the user in importing and managing multiple layouts in a Rhino document
2. Assembly Manager - Categorizes parts and components in assemblies and uses that organization system to keep track of quantities of parts, helps auto-labeling details in drawing sets, and prepares parts for production in model space.

The plugin is still in progress and documentation for getting started will be here after the system is fully functional.
